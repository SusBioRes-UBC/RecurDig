# RecurDig
Algorithm for digging out LCI of interest via recursion

### Development plan
flatten the nested dict
expand the function to do LCA and calculate ratios
validate with high recycle content example (e.g., recycled metals)
find bioeconomy related flows, covering multiple product categories, to make your point!

### Use of this algorithm
Summarize the inventory of interest (e.g., recycled flows) at each recursion level—>where high ‘circularity’ happens (e.g., the further away from your foreground, the harder you can influence)
Accordingly, the environmental impacts—>will there be ‘decoupling’ between high ‘circularity’ and high ‘GHG reduction’? (e.g., smaller use of recycled materials may lead to larger GHG reductions, which helps to identify the 
Aggregated recycled flows: what are different recycled flows associated with the FU? which one has the highest environmental benefits?
