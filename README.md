# RecurDig
Algorithm for digging out LCI of interest via recursion

### Development plan for latest version (ver 3)
- Enable the following:<br/>
  -list of keywords<br/>
  -aggregate values for the same keyword at each recursion lvl<br/>
- Expand the function to do LCA and calculate ratios<br/>
  -see: https://chris.mutel.org/calculating-inventory-flows.html<br/>
- Validate with high recycle content example (e.g., recycled metals)<br/>
- Find bioeconomy related processes & flows, covering multiple product categories, to make your point!<br/>

### Use of this algorithm
- Summarize the inventory of interest (e.g., recycled flows) at each recursion level—>where high ‘circularity’ happens (e.g., the further away from your foreground, the harder you can influence)<br/>
- Accordingly, the environmental impacts—>will there be ‘decoupling’ between high ‘circularity’ and high ‘GHG reduction’? (e.g., smaller use of recycled materials may lead to larger GHG reductions, which helps to identify the...?
- Aggregated recycled flows: what are different recycled flows associated with the FU? which one has the highest environmental benefits?<br/>
